Solving using Exponential Distributions:
1. Create a new column to record the # new cycles available (new_cycle) for every time interval (1 min) at each station.
2. For each station find lambda- an average rate of new cycles available per min
    * Do this by the formula Avg(new_cycle)/time_interval
3. For each station, model the exponential equation to compute the average wait time to get the next new cycle. 
    * **Divisions**: If the overall prediction is not accurate because the wait time varies by other factors. For example,
        * 2 new cycles are docked in 10mins at C4C station in the morning 
  			* 5 new cycles are docked in 10mins at C4C station in the evening
        * 0 new cycles are docked in 10mins at C4C station in the evening on Saturday 
  			* 10 new cycles are docked in 10mins at Folsom St station in the morning 
  			* 3 new cycles are docked in 10mins at Folsom St station in the evening 
  	
    Then, divide the model (or have individual exp equations) for:
   1. Each station
   2. Each day range (do this only if the values are different for each day)
        * Day range can be either be the following and it can vary for each station.
           * Every 7 days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sund or each time period
           * Just 3- morning, afternoon, and evening (if new_cycle variance is high between Morn, Aft, Eve but low within Morn, Aft, Eve)
           * Random sets like 7-10, 10-2, 2-5, 5-10, 10-12.
        
  Decide the divisions by analyzing where the **variance is across multiple divisions and is low within the division**.
	
**Potential # Equations**: In the worst case, let's say we have separate equations for 54 stations x 7 days x 3 time period, we will have a total of 1134 equations.
